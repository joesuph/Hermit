## Todo:

* Check definitions for circular dependencies
* Set up ability for projection
* Don't replace definitions, or alter spaces in strings
* Set up string interpolation
* Set up string functions
* Set up two argument modus ponens
* set up entailment type checking

## How do I handle projection?

* car and cdr
* Check that the type has n parts when index is given on compile or language server (so only static indices)
* Use a different structure for arrays which doesn't need to be static index or a function
